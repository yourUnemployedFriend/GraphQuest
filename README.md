## Overview

Basic game where you have to guess the graphic function shown in the canvas. Right now its just completing "f(x) = ??".

## Requirements

A browser, that's it. It's just javascript.

## How to play

1. Look at the graph
2. Write the function that you thing f(x) equals to
3. Press "Draw"

## Legend

- X multiplied: Either 2x or 2*x
- Power of: x^2 (not x²)
- sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)

## Todo

- Make lines smoother so theres curves

## Future plans

- Add different difficulties
